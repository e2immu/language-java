     To be called  from TypeMap only.
     The implementation will load as many types as necessary to load this source properly.
     It will only check with the type map for availability of types already loaded; it will NOT recursively start a
     loading process. Only at the end will the TypeMap store the loaded types.

     As a consequence, two parallel calls to inspectFromPath may be doing a bit of duplicate work, e.g. because
     the sources they load share a parent, enclosing type, or interface implemented.
